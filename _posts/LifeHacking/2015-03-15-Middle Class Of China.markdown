	Abstracts: With the inspiration of American dream, the middle class of America came into existence, played an essential role in many aspects of American society, including economy, politics, education, etc., which is still shaping or even changing the progress of America. Meanwhile, the number of middle class in China is expanding explosively due to the rapid development of economy.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">However, we tend to associate the middle class with the phrases of, ‘great wealth, purchasing power, lifestyle,’ etc. But the meaning of middle class are far more than that. This thesis analyse the middle class in China and America, to provide us some experience and help us gain some insights, to better develop the middle class in China.  
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">	Through comparison, we connect the middle class with democratization and social stabilization. For future prosper of our society, we need to build a strong middle class, those who are willing to take on social responsibilities and get involved with government decision-making process.

####1.	Introduction  
 <p style = "text-indent: 30px"> In recent decades, due to the bonus of population, China embrace its economic boom. Millions of middle class emerged in line with the rapid economic growth. But we seem to have little understanding of middle class, or even misread. However, the middle class of America had come into existence since the Industrial Revolution. This provides us a vivid sample to analyse the role of middle class. This thesis is designed to analyse the development and influence of middle class in America, compared with the middle class in China, to provide us an opportunity to gain some insights about the middle class.</p>

####2.	A driven force for economic growth
  
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;">By definition, middle class are a class of people in the middle hierarchy of society. [1] However, a simple standard for measuring is that a household with a third of its income for discretionary spending is considered middle class. Although there are other factors such as tertiary education, wealth, occupations. From the standard above, we can draw a conclusion that middle class are a group of people who possess a certain amount of capital and also with a secure income. Actually, we are familiar with consumerism in America, a great driven force for American economy, which is a reflection of economic clout mostly generated by the middle class. However, in China, we traditionally rely on massive investment on infrastructure construction and export-oriented business to develop our economy. And with the decay of population bonus and the globalization, cheap labor and resources-oriented industries are no more our advantage in the global competition. Fortunately, the emerging middle class may provide us a way out, to get rid of such a development mode and to fuel our economy again. Due to their consumption and needs for a service sectors, the middle class can play an important role in the transition to a domestic demand-driven society. And that is what is happening in China right now, our government is placing more emphasis on its domestic market, with a range of methods applied to increase consumption and boost the economy.  With its potential purchasing power, middle class may be a great driven force to our economic growth, what is more important, it is a way of sustainable development.

####3.Middle class are social stabilizer.
 <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, once said, a city ought to be composed, as far as possible, of equals and similar, and these are generally the middle classes. Wherefore the city which is composed of middle-class citizens is necessarily best constituted in respect of the elements of which we say the fabric of the state naturally consists. [2] The reason why the middle class are more stable than any other classes is that they don’t hold hostility toward the rich like the poor, don’t have enough wealth to be coveted like the rich, and they seldom plot against each other. Once when I was surfing the Internet, I found an interesting topic posted on Quora, a Q&A site, which is entitled as: What is the ugliest facts in the world?  And the answer which ranked first is ‘The poor walk a thousand miles to get the food, while the rich walk a thousand miles to digest it.’ Actually, it reflects an enormous gap between the rich and the poor. It is reported that the poorest 40 percent of the world’s population accounts for 5 percent of global income. The richest 20 percent accounts for three-quarters of world income. [3] While in highly unequal society, the gap between the rich and the poor will get wider and wider, which means the social conflicts may increase in line with that. And eventually, the poor may use violence to redistribute, and the rich may use the repression to prevent such a thing happen, and that may bring more uncertainty to the stabilization of the society. However, a relatively large and affluent middle class may acts as a buffer between the rich and the poor, and limit the redistribution. They are easier to dissuade from revolution since they don’t wanna the redistribution happen. Meanwhile, they may act as middle-dissident to change the policy toward the poor, which adjust the situation of the poor. What is more, since they are relatively closed to the poor, the poor may be influenced by their opinions. Therefore，besides the reason the middle class may boost the economy, being a social stabilizer may be another reason why our government is keen to expand the middle class for the harmony society.

####4.The middle class and the democratization
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Based on the history of democratization in America, the expansion of a society’s middle class has been recognized as a key factor in terms of promoting democratization. To further illustrate this topic, we need to know why the middle class are so influential. Firstly, it is about the professional middle class, one is that journalists, writers, professors, commentators, political scientist, who are essential in shaping the public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Secondly, some of them may hold an occupation which includes managerial duties, meaning they spend their work-time directing others. And hopefully, with a certain amount of wealth, social status, and enhancing awareness of individual rights, they may get involved with politics, demand a political reform to facilitate the democratization, act as social agent of political change, speed up the process of democratization by exerting pressure on the state. However, it seems the middle class in China show the tendency of distancing away from political. [4] Due to the insecure feeling towards the institution and the lack of social welfare, the middle class are more concern about their material interests rather than political. But still I believe parts of the middle class may promote democratization in terms of enhancing collective rights to voice out and challenge the state. And also, to better develop the middle class to sustain the economy and social stabilization, measures will be taken by the government to meet the benefits of this class. Otherwise, there are another ways out like immigration. And, hopefully, the middle class can play an active role in the process of democratization in China, instead of a middle class without democracy.

####5. Conclusion
 <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Middle class, with its potential economic power and political power, are now influencing the world. To have a better understanding of this class gives us an opportunity to better develop it and make the best use of it. We connect the social stabilization and democratization with the middle class in this thesis, analyzing its great influence and potential power. For future sustainable development of our society, we need to build a strong middle class, those who are willing to take on social responsibilities and get involved with government decision-making process.
